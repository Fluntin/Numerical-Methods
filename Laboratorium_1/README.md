## Convolution Plots

The `convolution_plots.m` script demonstrates convolution plots, a fundamental concept in signal processing. Convolution is a mathematical operation that combines two functions to produce a third function.

**Usage:**

```matlab
% Example usage
convolution_plots(signal1, signal2);
